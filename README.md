- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mat-Rix
I've been an on/off programmer as such for around 35years.
o CP/M [8080]. Coding in Basic, ASM
o Cobol,Pascal,OOP, C, C++ Unix,Linux,VMS, CSS,HTML, Excel Basic, Excel Macro scripts [8086, 80386,80486, Pentium, AMD64,today etc...]
o Code CAD scripts for TurboCAD, Solidworks CAD, Autocad...
o Dropped away from  C, C++ and prefer Borland Pascal, OOP, FreePascal,Delphi and now converting to Larzarus.
o Moving away from misanthropic "Microsoft Windows" and focusing on past years using Linux platform. 
The above should give the reader the general idea...  ...
